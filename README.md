# Code Editor Shortcuts

This [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin adds keyboard shortcuts (hotkeys) commonly found in code editors such as Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text.

| Command                                          | Shortcut\*                 |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Insert line below                                | `Ctrl` + `Enter`           |
| Insert line above                                | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Enter` |
| Delete line                                      | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `K`     |
| Join line below to current line                  | `Ctrl` + `J`               |
| Duplicate line                                   | `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `D`     |
| Select line (repeat to keep expanding selection) | `Ctrl` + `L`               |

\* On macOS, replace `Ctrl` with `Cmd`
